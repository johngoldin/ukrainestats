## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
path_saved_data <- "~/Documents/R_local_repos/ukrainestats/"
library(tidyverse)
library(curl)
source(paste0(path_saved_data, "R/ukraine_functions.R"))
mod_image <- fetch_ukr_mod_text(today(), fetch_image_url = TRUE)
#download.file(mod_image, destfile = "UA-MOD-casualty-image.jpg", method = "libcurl")
curl_download(mod_image, destfile = "UA-MOD-casualty-image.jpg", quiet = FALSE)
```

## 

Did this work? `r mod_image`
